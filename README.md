# SIEM-honeypot-project
Using Microsoft Azure I am going to setup a virtual machine and use the Log Analytics Workspace and Azure Sentinel(SIEM), in order to simulate a vulnerable computer and monitor and log the attacks from the different IP addresses and countries. The purpose of this is for me to gain familiarity and exposure to a SIEM and analyzing logs and patterns.
